defmodule Contentful.Delivery.Entries do
  @moduledoc """
  Entries allows for querying the entries of a space via `Contentful.Query`.

  ## Fetching a single entry

      import Contentful.Query
      alias Contentful.Delivery.Entries

      {:ok, entry} = Entries |> fetch_one("my_entry_id")

  ## Simple querying of a collection of entries

      import Contentful.Query
      alias Contentful.Delivery.Entries

      # fetches the entries based on the `space_id`, `environment` and `access_token` in config/config.exs
      {:ok, entries, total: _total_count_of_entries} =
        Entries |> fetch_all

      # fetches the entries by passing  `space_id`, `environment` and `access_token`
      space_id = "<my_space_id>"
      environment = "<my_environment>"
      access_token = "<my_access_token>"

      {:ok, entries, total: _total_count_of_entries} =
        Entries |> fetch_all(space_id, environment, access_token)

  ## More advanced query with included links

  Entries can have links included, which limits the amount of times a client has to request data from the server:

      import Contentful.Query
      alias Contentful.{Asset, Entry}
      alias Contentful.Delivery.Entries

      # The default include depth is 1 (max 10)
      {:ok, [ %Entry{} = entry | _ ], total: _total_count_of_entries} =
        Entries |> include |> fetch_all

      # any links within entry.fields will have been replaced with actual entities (e.g. an %Asset{] or %Entry{} struct)

  ## Accessing common resource attributes

  Entries embed `Contentful.SysData` with extra information about the entry:

    import Contentful.Query
    alias Contentful.{ContentType, Entry, SysData}
    alias Contentful.Delivery.Entries

    {:ok, entry} = Entries |> fetch_one("my_entry_id")

    "my_entry_id" = entry.id
    "<a timestamp for updated_at>" = entry.sys.updated_at
    "<a timestamp for created_at>" = entry.sys.created_at
    "<a locale string>" = entry.sys.locale
    %ContentType{id: "the_associated_content_type_id"} =  entry.sys.content_type
